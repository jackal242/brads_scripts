Install these two scripts into /etc/geo-blocking.

	* refrsh-geoblocking.sh will configure your ipset for you.  This assumes you have ipset installed (yum install ipset).

	* setup-iptables.sh will configure iptables to use the ipset rules.

You'll need to install an ipset init script as well.
	
	* ipset - move the script into /etc/init.d/ipset, then run "chkconfig --add ipset" to add it to the run levels.
		- this will run just before iptables, because you have to load the ipsets before iptables can load.
